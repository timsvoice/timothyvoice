                    Replicate your build process locally without Docker‚Äôs cache. Check the resulting Docker image and
                    upload a fresh zip file to EB for deployment to your environment. Run your build pipeline
                    successfully and get back to work.

                    First, some context. Our pipeline consists of a CI build process that is triggered by an update to a
                    GitHub branch. The build process runs some custom commands, creates a zip file for S3, and then
                    deploys
                    that build to Elastic Beanstalk. All this automation is awesome when things are working üçª, but it
                    can
                    leave you feeling powerless if something goes wrong üò≠.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a start, you should understand that Elastic Beanstalk is just the management layer for the
                    resources
                    your app uses on AWS, so you‚Äôre really debugging the underlying resources and your own deployment
                    pipeline. Debugging on remote systems can be a nightmare, especially doing so through a GUI like
                    Elastic
                    Beanstalk where hunting down information can be confusing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing to do is to replicate as much of your build process locally as you can, taking care
                    to
                    start fresh with every build. There are two big reasons to replicate you build pipeline locally:
                </p>
                <p>
                    You need information and the best place to run an experiment is in an environment you have (nearly)
                    total control of
                    Docker will cache a lot of the results from your RUN commands on EB, trapping any build gremlins
                    üëπin a
                    neat little cage, ready to wreak havoc on your next deployment despite the updates you‚Äôve made. The
                    tool
                    you need here is Docker‚Äôs <code>--no-cache</code> option so you can flush any nasties right out. Unfortunately
                    this
                    isn‚Äôt an option on EB (you can‚Äôt specify your build commands) so you will need to run this locally
                    Here‚Äôs a quick guide for creating a clean build:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Start with duplicating every command in your CI pipeline: from npm install to your build steps
                    Build a clean Docker image (without the cache) using this command: docker build --no-cache -t
                    app_name .
                    Bundle the Docker image: zip ../version.zip -r * .[^.]*
                    Run your Docker image locally and make sure you can get the thing working
                    You should now have either found the source of your pain, or have a nice, fresh zip file you can
                    upload
                    to EB.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upload this zip to Elastic Beanstalk in the Application Versions section of your Application
                    Environment.
                    Deploy the uploaded zip to an Application Environment and wait for the build to finish.
                    If all is well at this point, trigger a new build from your CI (if using one) and with any luck,
                    your
                    deployment pipeline will work and you can go back to focusing on building your awesome features
                    instead
                    of banging your head against the wall üéâ. If your deployment failed, rinse and repeat the above
                    steps,
                    digging deeper into each section to gain more information; you will get there eventually üò¨.
